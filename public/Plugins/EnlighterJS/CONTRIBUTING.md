EnlighterJS is OpenSource and managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndiDittrich/EnlighterJS) - if you like, you're welcome to contribute!
To simplify the release and quality control process, please follow these remarks:

* Your commits/pull-request should only contain changes of the `src/` directory or the README located into the root directory - otherwise i have to merge the request manually
* **Do not change** any files located in `dist/` directory - they are automatically generated during the build-process
* Related software packages like `node.js modules` or the build system are updated by the maintainer
